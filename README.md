A quick start for ComputerApp Class. Heard of Github for a long time. First time to know what it is about.

Currently I am a graduate student in University of Texas at El Paso, majored in Geology, or more specificly, geochemistry. Little computer apps have I used other than baisc Microsoft Office, Matlab. And this class seems to be very useful for me.

Command line is a very different system comparing with visible operation system like windows. That's why the basic commands are "pwd", "ls" which helps you to handle the structure of the file folders. Commands like "rm", "cp", "mv" can be used to manipulate these folders or files. In general, command line have much more freedom than the windows system. And it is more straightforward and simple, in some circumstances.

Github is a workflow app that can support the running of projects or teams. Three stages of "Working Directory", "Staging Area" and "Repository" help better managing the progress, especially from different people. This can be achieved by "git add" and "git commit" command. "git diff" can be very useful to find out the changes people have made. This is espeically helpful in group coding. Another important feature for github is the backtrack. It can withdraw the project to any previous stages, extremely useful when mistakes happened: no need to redo the whole process.
